# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this election audit analysis is to implement for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find results requested by the election commission. The additional data requested to complete the audit are to find the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. After finding these information, the results will then be printed out onto a .txt file.

## Results
