# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this election audit analysis is to implement for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find results requested by the election commission. The additional data requested to complete the audit are to find the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. After finding these information, the results will then be printed out onto a .txt file.

## Results

* How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
The total number of votes that were casted in this congressional election is 369,711 votes.

* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
Out of the total number of votes casted for the congressional election, Denver had 306,055 votes, which made 82.8% of the total votes. Denver had the largest voting turnout out of all the other counties. The second highest voting turnout was from the county Jefferson with 38,855 votes. This made only 10.5% of the total votes. The lowest voting turnout was from the county Arapahoe with 24,801 votes. This was 6.7% of the total votes from the congressional election. The following picture shows the results that support the analysis.

## Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
